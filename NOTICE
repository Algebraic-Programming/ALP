The experimental banshee backend has been developed in collaboration with
Prof. Luca Benini at ETH Zuerich and his group. In particular this backend
is with great thanks due to Dan, Paul Scheffler, Fabian Schuiki, and Samuel
Riedel.

The distributed-memory 1D backend additionally would not have been possible
without Wijnand J. Suijlen (Huawei Technologies France SASU) whom we'd like
to acknowledge specially. His feedback and the joint work on the Lightweight
Parallel Foundations (LPF) communication layer has helped shape our API's
support for distributed-memory parallelism.

We also acknowledge our lab director, Bill McColl, for his keen insights
and support this project has, and indeed continues to, benefit from.
